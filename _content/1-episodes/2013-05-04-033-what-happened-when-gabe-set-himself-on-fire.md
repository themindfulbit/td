summary: "This week Erik turns the tables on Gabe. First they chat about Gabe's wonky SSD, Launch Agents, the Genius Bar, various backup services, and troubleshooting techniques. This leads to an exploration of childhood dreams, chemistry sets, growing up geeky, blowing things up, setting yourself on fire, learning what is and isn't deadly, the fear of looking stupid, and what happens when you achieve your goals and find you're no longer happy.
