Helene Wecker is the author of [*The Golem and the Jinni*](http://www.helenewecker.com/the-golem-and-the-jinni-by-helene-wecker/synopsis-of-the-novel-the-golem-and-the-jinni/). Recently nominated for the 2013 Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America [Nebula Award](http://www.sfwa.org/nebula-awards/), the novel tells the story of a group of immigrants (both natural and supernatural) living in New York City at the turn of the last century.

{{ theme:partial src="image" title="" show="{{ number }}" file="helene-tgatj.jpg" }}

Helene got her start in the Marketing and Public Relations field. Seven years into her career, she decided to stop writing about other people's awesome projects and start working on her own instead. 

Having written Doctor Who and Star Trek [fanfic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_fiction) in high school and leaning on some additional experience in creative writing classes, Helene chose to pursue a career writing fiction. Perhaps leaning towards the [Type A](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory) side of the personality spectrum *(no comment – pw)* she was talented enough to graduate from the prestigious Master of Fine Arts Degree program at [Columbia University in New York](http://arts.columbia.edu/writing/about-mfa-program).

> At the end of [Technical Difficulties 67](http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/067-authoring-ibooks-with-david-sparks) with [David Sparks](http://twitter.com/macsparky), Gabe ressurected a [Generational](http://www.70decibels.com/generational/) feature he calls "Tell Me About Something You Like." In it, Gabe [told us](http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/067-authoring-ibooks-with-david-sparks#tgatj) about a great book he had just finished.
> 
> On his recommendation I made it my next audiobook, and Erik added it to his Kindle library. Well, it turns out that [the author herself heard the mention](https://twitter.com/helenewecker/status/441344873304571904) and after Gabe saw this, he was able to arrange this interview.
> 
> Though we were all a bit starstruck, Helene proved to be a gracious and wonderful guest. We think you'll agree.

Among the benefits of Helene's Columbia MFA program were the annual mixers which allowed students to interact with literary agents. While these events didn't offer any guarantees of representation (much less fame, fortune, and a show on HBO), Helene was able to make a connection with someone who could offer some guidance. Over a period of four to five years he helped her refine the novel and stay on track, eventually becoming her agent and helping Helene sell the novel to [HarperCollins Publishers](http://www.harpercollins.com/) when it was roughly half-complete.

{{ theme:partial src="section-header" title="The Basis for the story" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="19:49" }}

*The Golem and the Jinni* is a story that interweaves Jewish and Arab American traditions and mythologies amidst the backdrop of [New York City in 1899](http://www.helenewecker.com/new-york-in-1899/). Ensuring that a novel with such distinctive themes rang true required Helene to conduct exhaustive research and pay careful attention to the "rules" of the world she was creating.

Fortunately, Helene had access to family traditions from both cultures as well as the Columbia University library. That being said, making a [golem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem) and a
[jinni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinn) believably walk the streets of [The Lower East Side](http://www.helenewecker.com/new-york-in-1899/the-lower-east-side/) and [Little Syria](http://www.helenewecker.com/new-york-in-1899/little-syria/) requires an immense amount of good old-fashioned hard work – far more than just a quick viewing of [Funny Girl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funny_Girl_(film)).

When a story expands to the length of a novel, a line needs to be drawn somewhere between fleshing out a tale's detail, and writing a textbook. And what about the characters? A world needs a full cast to feel real, but nothing feels like more of a cheat to the reader than when the author's hand can be seen dropping an [extra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_\(acting\)) into the plot in order to keep things moving.

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="gabe" text="On Being a Writer" }}
>
> One of my favorite aspects of this interview was the obvious dichotomy of becoming a professional writer. Anyone can become a "real" writer and professional story teller, but not just anyone has the tenacity and professionalism to make it a career. I think Helene is a character study in the birth of a professional writer. She gave up a lucrative career, worked very hard at perfecting her craft, and stuck with it until someone noticed.
>
> While I do believe that it takes talent to be a professional writer, I think Helene's story is compeling because of her fortitude and persistence in achieving that status. It's fun, but it sure is a lot of hard work too.

Sometimes carefully prepared and even beloved writing has to go into the trash heap when it isn't right, and Helene experienced this herself when writing the ending of her book. Like a surgeon's cut, sometimes excess or damaged pieces need to be removed.

>
> Helene was kind enough to provide some additional information about the tools she used when writing her novel. While some elements were alluded to in the audio, we've interleaved some additional detail into the notes where appropriate.

>
> I treated myself to a new MacBook Pro back in December. I'd been saving up for a while, but I waited until they announced the new line. My old laptop was a five-year-old plain vanilla MacBook, and it was running on borrowed time. For the new one, I maxed out the memory and the processor, but not the storage. Now that I've decided to go paperless, I'm wondering if that was the best decision.

I'm sure there's some setting in its frustratingly Byzantine menu that fixes this, I just can't be bothered to find it. I certainly don't think you *need* an external monitor in order to write, but it does make it easier to look at research while writing, or two versions of a manuscript side by side.

(I need to be more diligent about that, probably with the help of [SuperDuper](http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/superduperdescription.html).) We've had a couple of bad-drive scares, but it's still chugging along. We'd like to buy a new one soon, if only because this one's making a noise like a lawnmower. Could be the pound's worth of cat hair in the fan.

>
> I didn't keep any research in Scrivener while writing THE GOLEM AND THE JINNI. Instead I stuck it all in Evernote, and went back and forth. But for the next book, I've been loading everything into Scrivener's research folder instead. It was just too irritating to switch between apps, especially when I'd start to second-guess myself over some historical detail: "Wait, did I really read this somewhere, or did I make it up?" And then I'd have to switch to Evernote and dig out the right note. Whereas if everything is in Scrivener, I can link from the draft in progress to the right document in the research folder. Once and done. 
> 
> Granted, it's much more of a pain to get everything into Scrivener. The Evernote folks have gone out of their way to give you 17 different ways to toss content into your notebooks, but with Scrivener it has to be done from inside the app. There's probably some way to use Hazel rules and AppleScript to save items into a Dropbox folder and then automatically load them into a predetermined Scrivener document, but learning AppleScript isn't high enough on my priority list to figure it out. Rumor has it that Literature & Latte is working on an iOS version of Scrivener, which I'd really love to see. Might give me a reason to use my iPad more often.

>
> I have a love-hate relationship with Evernote. Sometimes it's invaluable, and sometimes it feels like a junk closet. Admittedly, I'm not the best at keeping it organized. Recently I went through it and created a handful of new notebooks; hopefully that'll help. But part of the problem is that Evernote has really fuzzy boundaries, and ends up half-sharing the duties I use a lot of other apps for. Should I keep my to-read articles in Evernote, or in Instapaper? What about small but important pieces of reference info: Evernote, or Simplenote? Recipes are a no-brainer, but what about articles on time- or event-sensitive subjects, like tax advice or seasonal gardening tips? Do I create OmniFocus reminders for those, or make an Evernote "tickler" notebook a la GTD? It leads to muddy workflows and duplication of effort. Sometimes I'll do a Google search on something and toss the results into Evernote, only to see I'd already clipped that article a year ago. It's like buying a new lightbulb, and then finding a blister pack of them hidden in the linen closet.

> I stuck these two together because they really are a team: together, they're twice as useful as they would be alone. Since a lot of my research involves stuff like out-of-print books, old maps, and articles from academic journals, I end up making a lot of photocopies. This used to lead to entire shelves devoted to three-ring binders. Now that I have the ScanSnap and PDFPen, I'm turning it all digital. It's all on my laptop, right where I need it, and easily searchable.

While she used various techniques along the way, Helene gradually moved her story forward, often taking steps back into the past to refine a character's path through the story or correct wrong turns. This attention to detail and internal consistency allows for the reader to know that the book's universe has rules. Having other readers at this stage of development is particularly useful in order to avoid a [frog-in-a-pot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog) scenario. A word of caution: learning this skill may ruin your ability to enjoy entire swaths of literature.

>
> I said this in the show too, but it bears repeating: I don't know how I could've written THE GOLEM AND THE JINNI without Scrivener. That book had at least a dozen moving parts, and Scrivener allowed me to treat them as exactly that: parts that I could move around, swap in and out, try out different versions of, banish to a "graveyard" folder and later resurrect if I felt like it. I bought Scrivener in '06 or '07, back when it wasn't quite so feature-rich. I'm sort of glad I did; I know

> In the past I've rotated between Notational Velocity, NVAlt, and Simplenote, and right now Simplenote's on top. I'm pretty happy with it, though I miss Notational Velocity's nifty "search and create from the same line" feature. I used to keep *everything* I wrote (that wasn't part of a book) in Simplenote, including the short-to-midlength pieces I now write in Byword. But that started to get unwieldy, and it gunked up the search results. Now I use Simplenote mostly for lists, reference
> info that I need to access quickly and often, and travel itineraries. The sync to iOS is pretty reliable; I've had my grocery list decouple a few times, I suspect because I had it open and edited in both devices. So now I keep a template, just in case.

I like it quite a bit, though some of the actions don't behave the I want them to, so they don't stick in my muscle memory as well as I'd like. The horizontal view is fabulous for looking at a lot of info on the screen at once. Weirdly, I use Tree to write presentations instead of Scrivener, which would be the more obvious choice. I think my brain has partitioned off Scrivener for writing fiction; doing anything else in the app just feels odd.

> Oh man, do I wish Aeon Timeline had been around eight years ago. AT lets you create incredibly complex but easily readable timelines, along decades or years or even minutes. (Scifi and fantasy writers, check out the feature that lets you define non-Earth-standard time increments!) You can organize your events along different "arcs," which is incredibly helpful if you want to keep groups of events separate from each other, but still want to see where they intersect. For my next book, I've built a timeline with different arcs for events from World War I, New York history, the lives of various historical figures (Ameen Rihani, Louis Brandeis, T.E. Lawrence, etc.), and the lives of my own characters. So when I go to actually write the book, I can be clear on which real-world events have already happened, which will happen within the course of the book (and possibly influence the characters' actions or attitudes), and which events the characters will create themselves in the course of the plot. If this sounds confusing, just take a look at the demo, where they've broken down the entire plot of *Murder on the Orient Express.* It took me about a half hour of playing with AT to go from "Hmm, it's a little pricey" to "SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY."

Of course, my email needs are relatively uncomplicated: I've only got one account to manage, and I don't have to worry about syncing with an Outlook server or the like.

These days, I have a lot to respond to, much of it time-sensitive. I'm still trying to figure out how to manage it all. I set up a bunch of filters set up to move low-priority email to a "Later" folder, so that (hopefully) the most important emails float to the top, but I don't entirely trust it yet. I tried the SaneBox demo, but I'm too much of a control freak to be happy with it. I kept second-guessing the algorithm, and wondering what I wasn't seeing. Maybe someday I'll be able to let go (and justify the annual fee), but for now I'll keep struggling with email on my own.

I used to keep separate folders for work projects, travel, and home or personal projects, regardless of whether they were short-term or ongoing. Now, as soon as a project gets a deadline, it goes in the Deadlines folder, no matter which part of my life it comes from. That way I can scan the folder quickly to see what I've got coming down the pike.

It would feel weird *not* to have my next book represented in OF in some way, since it's the biggest thing on my plate. But at least with the last book, once I was in the thick of writing, a daily repeating OF task labeled "Write two hours" seemed kind of silly. Kind of like having a task called "Eat lunch" or "Put your clothes on." What the hell else was I going
> to do that day? So right now, my next-book OF project only has a few ancillary tasks in it, like "Research NYC orphanages in 1910s," and "Go to UC Berkeley library for JSTOR access." Maybe as I (hopefully) acquire an official deadline and the book gains substance and momentum, I'll figure out a good way to break it down into trackable chunks.

> I finally bought Hazel about a month ago, after hearing everyone talk about it ad nauseam. I've barely scratched the surface of what it can do, but already it's saving me tons of time and mental energy. Moreover, Hazel makes me think about how I label my documents upfront, instead of what I used to do: just call them any old thing and toss them in a giant bucket. It's helping me create an in-the-moment organizational discipline that, with any luck, will spill  over into other aspects of my

> I've been tinkering with TextExpander for a few months, figuring out where the big wins are. At first I created a zillion snippets for small, often-used phrases, but I found it was more effort to remember the snippet than to just type out the phrase. Now I'm much more interested in long-form snippets. Recently I figured out how to use TextExpander snippets to write answers to frequently asked questions. I tend to answer the same dozen or so questions repeatedly, either in email interviews
> or in readers' emails. I wanted a way to speed up the process, but I didn't want to copy and paste canned responses. So I developed a set of snippets that present me with lists of phrases related to each answer. For instance, if someone asks about my inspiration for THE GOLEM AND THE JINNI, I type ".inspiration" and get this:
> 
>
>  > started at Columbia   
> working on short stories   
> combined tales from families   
> immigration to America  
> issues of language, culture   
> collection refused    
> complained to a friend    
> she pointed out  
> realist stories  
> sci-fi and fantasy  
> challenged me  
> fantastical instead  
> switched characters  
> golem and jinni   
> 
> 
> Now I have a handy cheat-sheet of phrases. I can incorporate them straight into my answer, or reword and tinker with them, or just read them over to get the engine going and then write something completely different. This way I can to tailor each response to fit the situation (relaxed-and-chatty blog Q&A vs. more formal press interview, etc.) without having to start each answer over again from square one.

When you write a book over a period of years, there are likely going to be sections that benefit unequally from increasing skill. This is usually transparent to the reader, but an author may want a few more editorial passes done on a completed book, if they are forced to spend to much time with their own words.

This is made worse for someone hearing [George Guidall](http://www.audible.com/guestauthor/Guest_Editor_Narrator_Guidall) perform their story. [Dostoevsky](http://www.audible.com/pd/Classics/Crime-and-Punishment-Recorded-Books-Edition-Audiobook/B002V5GTWA) might even want to revise a paragraph here or there.

Proper (we hope) name pronunciation is one of the benefits of hearing a professional read a book to you, and the characters in *The Golem and the Jinni* really highlight this. Helene's method of combining names from family members, ship manifests, and other period source material give the world its feeling of reality.

> This doesn't have to do with writing per se, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention [You Need a Budget (YNAB)](http://www.youneedabudget.com/). I'm essentially a freelancer now, so I get paid in erratically spaced, odd-sized chunks. That means I need serious control over my monthly expenses, so I can build a cushion for myself and have some certainty about how long it'll last. And then there's the joy of quarterly taxes, saving for retirement, tickets home for the holidays, etc. It didn't happen overnight, but with YNAB's help, I've managed to create a realistic, all-inclusive budget and stick to it, for the first time in my life. Frankly, it feels pretty great.

For the sake of listeners who haven't had a chance to read the book yet, there are spoilers from this point on. Once you have finished, you can return to this section of the audio which adds additional character insight and some thoughts on faith in the world of the golem and the jinni.

>
> Science fiction and fantasy has gotten a bad rap over the years. For a long time it was second class to works by authors that focused solely on the human condition, like Hemingway and Fitzgerald. I made my way to the genre through Vonnegut, who elegantly intertwined time travel and alien planets with alcoholism and suicide. It was a surprise when I learned that fiction and scifi were two separate things.
> With the popularity of vampire stories and comic book movies, I think the mainstream is steadily moving toward my own happy conclusion: SciFi is just fiction with an imagination.
