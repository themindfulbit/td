### Do you scan much?

Erik and Gabe talk about general scanning workflows, Erik tries (and fails) to remember what the stuff the postal service delivers is called, and Gabe reveals a deep-seated hatred for paper on his desk. We judge.

>
>  The [first rule](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/) of Gabe's desk is that nothing goes on Gabe's desk.

* Once it's set up, the [Fujitsu ScanSnap iX500](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ATZ9QMO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00ATZ9QMO&linkCode=as2&tag=potatowire-20) can connect to your computer via WiFi, allowing your "scanning pedestal" to be free of wires. 
* Erik's "legacy" [ScanSnap S1500M](http://www.fujitsu.com/us/services/computing/peripherals/scanners/scansnap/scansnap-s1500m.html) retains most of the same capability as newer models, but is a strictly USB device.

* The only time the computer is needed is to change the scanner's configuration, which means your desk can be a paper-free zone

### Scanning Workflow at the Desk

{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="1:12" }} 

* The linchpin of Gabe's system is to process incoming paper according to [GTD](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofNR_WkoCE&t=40) principles. 
* Anything that is not sensitive in nature can be scanned, and by Gabe's default, will go right into [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com/referral/Registration.action?uid=117091&sig=c008e6b26a1839c60958169092eb6b42).

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="erik" text="Evernote Inbox" }}
>
> Like Gabe, I have my ScanSnap import to Evernote by default. Beyond the ScanSnap itself, the key to keeping my scanning workflow as easy-to-use and frictionless as possible is maintaining an "Inbox" notebook so I can decouple the scanning and processing stages of my workflow.
>
> With a dedicated Evernote inbox I can quickly scan in several document sets, then figure out what to do with it all (what to call the notes, what to tag them, where to file them, etc.) at a more convenient time – usually ["later"](http://term.ly/procrastination). If you find yourself being lazy like me and leaving a lot of time between processing periods, Evernote's [OCR](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition/) saves you by allowing full search of the PDF whether you've figured out where to file it or not.
>
> This kind of search (especially while mobile) is what makes Evernote practically irreplaceable for me.

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="potatowire" text="Filesystem Inbox" }}
>
> Like Erik, I also have "legacy" ScanSnap, but I'm not an Evernote user. I like batch processing as well, so my ScanSnap just dumps the OCRed PDFs into a folder within my Dropbox that I've set up to act as an inbox. 
>
> Incidentally, the Fujitsu scanning software can be set to OCR after each scan using [ABBYY FineReader](http://finereader.abbyy.com/), which Fujitsu includes with the ScanSnap. You can also use FineReader to OCR your PDFs in batches later, and the accuracy is very good either way. What I like is that the OCR data becomes a part of the PDF, making it searchable by more than just Evernote. 

* For any documents that are better off encrypted, you can change the configuration on the Mac so all scans can be [secured](http://www.strategypage.com/humor/articles/20020406.asp) manually.

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="potatowire" text="Encryption" }}
>
>  There are many ways to encrypt the scanned data at this point. Each PDF can be separately encoded right in OS X or in an app like [PDFpen](http://smilesoftware.com/PDFpen/index.html).
> 
> {{ theme:partial src="image-set" show="{{ number }}" title="Preview" file="preview_encryption.png" }}{{ theme:partial src="image-set" show="{{ number }}" title="PDFpen" file="PDFpen_encryption.png" }}
> 
> You can also keep all sensitive information in a [disk image](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_image/) that be encrypted natively by [OS X](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1578) or by using an app such as [Knox](https://agilebits.com/knox/).

* If you're using an encrypted disk image, [DEVONthink](http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/) can process the scans into the disk image once you've unlocked it, as Gabe describes.

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="potatowire" text="More on DEVONthink" }}
>
>   Erik and Gabe spent some time with Jim Neumann of DEVONtechnologies on [Generational 042](/episodes/042-exploring-devonthink-with-jim-neumann), and it's a great way to learn more about DEVONthink.

* Opinions vary on what to keep, but often, hard copies are more convenient to reference later. As for where to keep them, there are plenty of fire safes out there, but [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QWZINW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004QWZINW&linkCode=as2&tag=potatowire-20) SentrySafe has been a great choice for many years.

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="potatowire" text="Hardcopies" }}
>
>  The question of what to keep in hard copy has always bothered me, so I keep more than I should. In general, taxes probably represent the area I have been most paranoid about meticulous record keeping, but that doesn't meant that you need to keep shoe boxes full of receipts around for years to come. The IRS has [some guidance](http://www.irs.gov/publications/p17/ch01.html#en_US_2012_publink1000170670) on what to keep, but, "The IRS does not require you to keep your records in a particular way. Keep them in a manner that allows you and the IRS to determine your correct tax." This seems surprisingly reasonable to me.

### Scanning Workflow on the Go

{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="13:58" }}

There are many good apps for scanning on the go, and depending on your needs, an iOS device can be your only scanner. 

* [Scanner Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-by-readdle/id333710667?mt=8&uo=4&at=11lqk8) by Readdle - Faxing for $0.99 a unit

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="potatowire" text="A Bad deal?" }}
>
> Unless I am bad at math (maths, [@imyke](http://twitter.com/imyke)), the package deals will waste some of your hard-earned pennies.

* [Genius Scan](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/genius-scan-pdf-scanner/id377672876?mt=8&uo=4&at=11lqk8) by The Grizzly Labs - Their other app [Genius Fax](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/genius-fax-fax-pdf-documents/id566504821?mt=8&uo=4&at=11lqk8) can (unsurprisingly) be used to fax. It offers better package pricing than Scanner Pro.

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="potatowire" text="A Great Hack" }}
>
>  Erik's comment about the "steam cleaner" scanner form factor brought [this hack](http://www.mpetroff.net/archives/2013/09/25/scanner-modifications-to-scan-large-documents/) to mind. Overlap and [image stitching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_stitching) managed by python? Pretty cool.


OCR on iOS has come a long way since Gabe's "not great" [OCRKit](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id388421968?mt=8&uo=4&at=11lqk8), and new apps offer a very reliable way to create searchable documents.

* [ABBYY FineScanner](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/finescanner/id534203582?mt=8&uo=4&at=11lqk8)
* [Receiptmate](https://itunes.apple.com/app/receiptmate-scan-your-receipts/id668694949?mt=8&uo=4&at=11lqk8) scans right to Evernote and it it can even provide spending reports.
* Gabe's Canon PIXMA MX880 has been replaced by the [MX922](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AVWKUJS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creRtiveASIN=B00AVWKUJS&linkCode=as2&tag=potatowire-20).
