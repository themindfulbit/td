summary: >
  Paul Mayne joins Gabe and Erik to
  discuss how he uses a daily journal and
  why he created Day One. They then talk a
  bit about how people use Day One, the
  role of journaling in the modern world,
  and where Day One is headed in the
  future. Then they go off topic to ponder
  whether the concept of "saving" a file
  is dead, and if not whether we can move
  beyond the anachronistic floppy disk
  icon.
