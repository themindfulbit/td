> This week is the first of what will be monthly episodes with a guest and a slightly longer running time. We don't think that anyone reading this or listening to the episode needs an introduction to Merlin Mann, but we do want to set the stage a little bit.
> 
> Just as this podcast is essentially Generational reborn, many of us have at one point reinvented ourselves. Sometimes this reinvention is more of a realization, and sometimes we make a conscious decision to make a change. When Erik and Gabe decided they wanted to talk about this together, they thought Merlin would be the perfect guest to serve as both foil and therapist. He graciously agreed to join them on this episode, and we think you will enjoy the result.
> 
> If you haven't read Merlin's [own](http://www.merlinmann.com) introduction in a while, you should take a look. It's perfect.

* As a [connoisseur of select tree nuts](https://vimeo.com/885133), Merlin has developed a distinguishing palate of salty treats and healthy living.
* [Merlin is on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies) but you probably shouldn't follow him. Well OK, just follow him for a little while. Maybe until you start to understand [his jokes](https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/status/404459653968297984).
* Merlin is also [on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/merlin/videos).
* Merlin's interview on [The Great Discontent](http://thegreatdiscontent.com/merlin-mann) is a wonderful introduction.

* Merlin has co-hosted [Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w‎/) with [Dan Benjamin](http://benjamin.org/dan/) since January 18, 2011.
* [You Look Nice Today](http://youlooknicetoday.com) holds a special place in every nerd's heart. The trio of Merlin, [Scott Simpson](http://yourmonkeycalled.com) and [Lonely Sandwich](http://sandwichvideo.com) were proof that smart humor is timeless and that we all missed out on the potential for baby butlers.
* Merlin's appearances on MacBreak Weekly are some of the best episodes of tech podcasting and date [way back to 2006](http://twit.tv/mbw18). Just start in the [archives](http://twit.tv/show/macbreak-weekly?page=53) and work your way forward.
* Merlin has delivered [many tutorials](http://www.pixelcorps.tv/macbreak33) and [application reviews](http://www.pixelcorps.tv/macbreak301) through the, mostly defunct, MacBreak show. If you're like us, it was [a Merlin video](http://www.pixelcorps.tv/macbreak12) in 2006 that introduced you to the power of Quicksilver and changed the way you used your Mac (also the first thing he ever did with Leo Laporte). At least until Quicksilver [broke your heart](http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/2409037212/quicksilver).
* [The Merlin Show](http://www.themerlinshow.com)
* [This Week in Tech](http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-tech?page=62)
* Merlin's most recent visit on TWIT was [way back in 2011](http://wiki.twit.tv/wiki/TWiT_316)
* Merlin's been involved with OmniFocus since before the first public release. The application has benefitted from his unique influence and you can watch his [most recent video](https://vimeo.com/61207928) about how he uses the tool.

> The show notes you are reading right now take a lot of work. It's work that we believe is worth the time and effort, thanks to Merlin. The Back to Work show notes are the inspiration that started us along this path. Merlin is very often the originator of the things I find valuable and interesting.

### "I am mainly former things"

{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="0:00" }} 

Erik begins the podcast by preaching some Apple heresy, is named the [Marie Curie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie) of the podcast and is discovered to be the real world [Mr. Burns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Burns).

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="0:27" person="merlin" quote="That doesn't cancer your balls or anything?" }} 

Merlin explains that he didn't decide to do [43 Folders](http://www.43folders.com), but instead realized that he was already doing it and likens early life to a map primarily built around school. Deviations from the map build the resiliency needed to properly navigate the territory.

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="10:30" person="merlin" quote="I'm not saying go out and just be a hobo" }}

When you [think outside the box](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_outside_the_box), sometimes you realize that you've "entered a new" box only by looking backwards. Worrying too much about the box means missed opportunity.

### Nouns and Verbs

{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="15:34" }} 

Merlin talks about our obsession with [naming things](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5285531),  revisits [nouns](http://www.43folders.com/2004/10/04/capital-letter-nouns-v-lower-case-verbs)  [and](http://www.43folders.com/2006/11/14/project-versus-next-action) [verbs](http://www.43folders.com/2006/10/15/look-into), and prevents us from ever not-imagining a pimply, pudgy, masturbating, 13-year-old version of him.

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="19:33" person="merlin" quote="...you need a good noun" }} 

Beyond just the nouns and verbs, we are obsessed with labels, but sometimes they can only be applied when the [work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla) [is](http://www.thomasedison.com) [done](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_jobs). Maybe it's [chunking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)), but we need to beware othe lack of creativity that this connotes. We also discover that Merlin's presentation may be a [MacGuffin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin), but in the end, you'll still get to pal around with him and have a steak.

Perhaps he is just trying desperately to avoid having a label.

* Success vs. fame

### Doing this Other Thing

{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="27:39" }} 

While nearly returning once more to the nouns-and-verbs well, Merlin helps up know when to un-pot ourselves, even though learning to take risks and thinking [orthogonally](http://term.ly/orthogonal) may land us in a [Mississippi chain gang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_gang).

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="28:06" person="merlin" quote="That's a really, really big question" }}

* Gabe channels [Cal Newport](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUQjAAwsKR8), reacting strongly [against](http://www.theminimalists.com/cal/) passions, but Merlin points out the limitless [career potential](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_gaming_in_South_Korea#Pro-gaming) abroad.

### Running Away from Discomfort

{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="35:53" }} 

Gabe talks a bit more about why he made his change and another way [he is like a cowboy](http://www.macdrifter.com/2013/11/the-saddleback-briefcase.html). Merlin [problematizes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problematization) all the way back to [Roald Dahl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Dahl)

### Forced Reinvention

{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="44:45" }} 

Whether or not achieving quality of life is a [#firstworldproblem](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23firstworldproblems) or not, sometimes we have to shift into emergency mode and reinvention isn't a choice. Merlin cautions us that this emergency mindset can taint our decisions long after we have reattained stability. Also, emotional pet shops.

>
> The concept of three worlds is a carryover from the [Cold War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War). It came into being after [World War II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) as a way to describe the split of the globe in to two large [blocs](http://term.ly/bloc), [Communism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism) and [capitalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism). The [First World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World) represented the capitalist West, democracy, moonbeams, and unicorns. The [Second World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World) represented, communism, [socialist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism), [industrial states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country), red stars, and evil. The [Third World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World) represented everyone else not aligned with the First or Second Worlds.
>
> This idea was also formed when everything was seen to be evolving, and the First World was defined as the bright and shining light that the other "worlds" would eventually become. Unsurprisingly, this opinion wasn't universally held, and [Mao Zedong's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong) alternative [Three Worlds Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Worlds_Theory) divides the globe into [superpowers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower) (First World) and the superpowers' allies (Second World), with [the leftovers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement) as the Third World.
>
> This term no longer has its original clear definitions, and the First World is now used as a [pot-and-kettle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_pot_calling_the_kettle_black) shaming technique on Twitter, and the Third World as a convenient "bin" for the aforementioned shamers and politicians to put poor foreigners. Fortunately, First World folks have now defined a [Fourth World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_World) in which to put the weird people from their own countries.

Erik [revisits fear and failure](http://themindfulbit.com/blog/fear-and-failure), and he and Merlin talk about [meditation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness) while Gabe silently judges them.

> 
> Therapy for whom? 

### What Happens After Reinvention

{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="55:00" }} 

Merlin ponders how we change, what our personal [admixture](http://term.ly/admixture) might be, and why feelings of incompetence can be a good thing.

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="59:48" person="gabe" quote="You're going to spend a lot of your cycles just trying to figure out what you should be learning" }} 

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="potatowire" text="Producer's Note" }}
> 
> Merlin's reference to [William James](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James) is likely the result of the [epigram](http://term.ly/epigram) often attributed to him: "Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity." This quip, which runs parallel to [Occam's Razor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_Razor), has also been attributed to [Napoleon Bonaparte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon) and [Richard Feynman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) referred to as [Hanlon's Razor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor), but the James tie seems most common on the internet due to a [Jargon File Entry](http://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-2.2.1.dos.txt). I have more about why "Hanlon," but you're just here for Merlin anyway….
