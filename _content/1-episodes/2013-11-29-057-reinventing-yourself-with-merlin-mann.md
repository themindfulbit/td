> 
> This week is the first of what will be monthly episodes with a guest and a slightly longer running time. We don't think that anyone reading this or listening to the episode needs an introduction to Merlin Mann, but we do want to set the stage a little bit.
> 
> Just as this podcast is essentially Generational reborn, many of us have at one point reinvented ourselves. Sometimes this reinvention is more of a realization, and sometimes we make a conscious decision to make a change. When Erik and Gabe decided they wanted to talk about this together, they thought Merlin would be the perfect guest to serve as both foil and therapist. He graciously agreed to join them on this episode, and we think you will enjoy the result.
> 
> If you haven't read Merlin's [own](http://www.merlinmann.com) introduction in a while, you should take a look. It's perfect.

* [Merlin is on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies) but you probably shouldn't follow him. Well OK, just follow him for a little while. Maybe until you start to understand [his jokes](https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/status/404459653968297984).
* Merlin is also [on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/merlin/videos).
* Merlin's interview on [The Great Discontent](http://thegreatdiscontent.com/merlin-mann) is a wonderful introduction.

* Merlin has co-hosted [Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w‎/) with [Dan Benjamin](http://benjamin.org/dan/) since January 18, 2011.
* [You Look Nice Today](http://youlooknicetoday.com) holds a special place in every nerd's heart. The trio of Merlin, [Scott Simpson](http://yourmonkeycalled.com) and [Lonely Sandwich](http://sandwichvideo.com) were proof that smart humor is timeless and that we all missed out on the potential for baby butlers.
* Merlin's appearances on MacBreak Weekly are some of the best episodes of tech podcasting and date [way back to 2006](http://twit.tv/mbw18). Just start in the [archives](http://twit.tv/show/macbreak-weekly?page=53) and work your way forward.
* Merlin has delivered [many tutorials](http://www.pixelcorps.tv/macbreak33) and [application reviews](http://www.pixelcorps.tv/macbreak301) through the, mostly defunct, MacBreak show. If you're like us, it was [a Merlin video](http://www.pixelcorps.tv/macbreak12) in 2006 that introduced you to the power of Quicksilver and changed the way you used your Mac (also the first thing he ever did with Leo Laporte). At least until Quicksilver [broke your heart](http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/2409037212/quicksilver).
* [The Merlin Show](http://www.themerlinshow.com)

* Merlin's been involved with OmniFocus since before the first public release. The application has benefitted from his unique influence and you can watch his [most recent video](https://vimeo.com/61207928) about how he uses the tool.

> The show notes you are reading right now take a lot of work. It's work that we believe is worth the time and effort, thanks to Merlin. The Back to Work show notes are the inspiration that started us along this path. Merlin is very often the originator of the things I find valuable and interesting.

### "I am mainly former things"

{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloud-url }}" time="0:00" }} 

Erik begins the podcast by preaching some Apple heresy, is named the [Marie Curie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie) of the podcast and is discovered to be the real world [Mr. Burns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Burns).

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloud-url }}" time="0:27" person="merlin" quote="That doesn't cancer your balls or anything?" }} 

Merlin explains that he didn't decide to do [43 Folders](http://www.43folders.com), but instead realized that he was already doing it and likens early life to a map primarily built around school. Deviations from the map build the resiliency needed to properly navigate the territory.

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloud-url }}" time="10:30" person="merlin" quote="I'm not saying go out and just be a hobo" }}

When you [think outside the box](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_outside_the_box), sometimes you realize that you've "entered a new" box only by looking backwards. Worrying too much about the box means missed opportunity.

* Usually being an undeclared major isn't about being open-minded.

### Nouns and Verbs

{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloud-url }}" time="15:34" }} 

Merlin talks about our obsession with [naming things](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5285531),  revisits [nouns](http://www.43folders.com/2004/10/04/capital-letter-nouns-v-lower-case-verbs)  [and](http://www.43folders.com/2006/11/14/project-versus-next-action) [verbs](http://www.43folders.com/2006/10/15/look-into), and prevents us from ever not-imagining a pimply, pudgy, masturbating, 13-year-old version of him.

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloud-url }}" time="19:33" person="merlin" quote="...you need a good noun" }} 

Beyond just the nouns and verbs, we are obsessed with labels, but sometimes they can only be applied when the [work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla) [is](http://www.thomasedison.com) [done](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_jobs). Maybe it's [chunking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)), but we need to beware othe lack of creativity that this connotes. We also discover that Merlin's presentation may be a [MacGuffin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin), but in the end, you'll still get to pal around with him and have a steak.

* Because nothing says [Serial Entrepreneur](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=serial%20entrepreneur) like a [good business card](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoIvd3zzu4Y).

Perhaps he is just trying desperately to avoid having a label

* Success vs. fame

### Doing this Other Thing

{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloud-url }}" time="27:39" }} 

While nearly returning once more to the nouns-and-verbs well, Merlin helps up know when to un-pot ourselves, even though learning to take risks and thinking [orthogonally](http://term.ly/orthogonal) may land us in a [Mississippi chain gang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_gang).

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloud-url }}" time="28:06" person="merlin" quote="That's a really, really big question" }}

* Gabe channels [Cal Newport](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUQjAAwsKR8), reacting strongly [against](http://www.theminimalists.com/cal/) passions, but Merlin points out the limitless [career potential](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_gaming_in_South_Korea#Pro-gaming) abroad.

### Running Away from Discomfort

{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloud-url }}" time="35:53" }} 

Gabe talks a bit more about why he made his change and another way [he is like a cowboy](http://www.macdrifter.com/2013/11/the-saddleback-briefcase.html). Merlin [problematizes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problematization) all the way back to [Roald Dahl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Dahl)

### Forced Reinvention

{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloud-url }}" time="44:45" }} 

Whether or not achieving quality of life is a [#firstworldproblem](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23firstworldproblems) or not, sometimes we have to shift into emergency mode and reinvention isn't a choice. Merlin cautions us that this emergency mindset can taint our decisions long after we have reattained stability. Also, emotional pet shops.

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloud-url }}" time="45:23" person="merlin" quote="They seem to have pretty steady access to the internet" }}

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloud-url }}" time="47:00" person="merlin" quote="I'm going to stop with the whores" }} 

* "The talk where I cried" [Merlin Mann Webstock 2011](https://vimeo.com/21730173)

> I don't think [transference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transference) is the right word.

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloud-url }}" time="51:38" person="erik" quote="It's better to be dead than look stupid, but it is possible to do both" }}

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="erik" text="On Fleet Week" }}
>
> I have a lot of family in the Bay Area, and I've listened to them complain for years about low-flying jets during [Fleet Week](http://www.fleetweek.us/). Here are a couple of important notes.
>
> First off, the only Navy airplanes who are ever allowed to fly low over populated areas in peacetime are the [Blue Angels](http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/), the Navy's aerial demonstration team. Any other low-flying Navy jet is either landing, taking off, or has a pilot who is about to get [FNAEB'd](http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/milpersman/1000/1600Performance/Documents/1610-020.pdf) (pronounced FEE-NABBED). 
> 
> For Fleet Week, it's the Blue Angels who are doing the low flying, either for the pre-show rehearsal or for their actual demonstration during the event. Flying low at 500 miles an hour is really difficult and takes a lot of practice to do it safely. 
> 
> Each winter the Blues go to sunny [NAF El Centro, CA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAF_El_Centro) and practice nothing but their show routine over the desert twice a day, six days a week, for two full months before doing it for real at the NAS Pensacola airshow. I've been lucky enough to work with a few former and future Blue Angels, and these guys take professionalism to a new level. Their post-flight debriefings are [merciless](http://vimeo.com/60346244). Being a Blue Angel one of the hardest jobs in Naval Aviation.
>
> Unfortunately for everybody, due to the [sequestration cuts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequester_\(2013\)), the Blue Angels were barred from flying airshows (including Fleet Week) since their role was deemed non-mission-essential. Unless Congress fixes the current budget mess it's unknown when they'll start flying demonstrations again. 

Erik [revisits fear and failure](http://themindfulbit.com/blog/fear-and-failure), and he and Merlin talk about [meditation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness) while Gabe silently judges them.

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloud-url }}" time="52:12" person="erik" quote="It's called therapy" }} 

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="potatowire" text="Producer's Note" }}
> 
> Therapy for whom? 



### What Happens After Reinvention

{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloud-url }}" time="55:00" }} 

Merlin ponders how we change, what our personal [admixture](http://term.ly/admixture) might be, and why feelings of incompetence can be a good thing.

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloud-url }}" time="59:48" person="gabe" quote="You're going to spend a lot of your cycles just trying to figure out what you should be learning" }} 

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="potatowire" text="Producer's Note" }}
> 
> Merlin's reference to [William James](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James) is likely the result of the epigram often attributed to him: "Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity." This quip, which runs parallel to [Occam's Razor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_Razor), has also been attributed to [Napoleon Bonaparte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon) and [Richard Feynman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) referred to as [Hanlon's Razor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor), but the James tie seems most common on the internet due to a [Jargon File Entry](http://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-2.2.1.dos.txt). I have more about why "Hanlon," but you're just here for Merlin anyway….
